## Data Modeling

Our primary goal is to deliver an MVP; henceforward, we decided to change the data structure to locally store the quiz's questions and use Firebase to focus on the user's settings storage. Following is the drawing of the current model. We will update it once we include the saving user's progress functionality.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
