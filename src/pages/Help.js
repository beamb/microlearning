      <p>Navigate to “Settings” and select whether you should be asked 5, 10 or 15
questions at a time. Remember, you always have the possibility to keep going
after you’re done answering your set number of questions. If you choose to 
continue, your next session will have the same number of questions as your 
previous one. You can always quit in the middle of a session - however, your 
progress will not be stored in case you quit before the end of a session.</p>
